# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to provide evidence regarding a case of academic dishonesty in terms of the reading and math grades of ninth graders at Thomas High School (THS). This analysis will help the school board understand the degree of any possible academic dishonesty conducted. To complete our goal, I will replace the reading and math scores for THS and complete an analysis of entire school district to compare the scores with and without THS.

# Results
## How is the district summary affected?
Replacing the ninth graders' reading and math scores had a minimal influence on the overall scores (Average Math Score, Average Reading Scores, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing). For example, the district_summary_df in the (file name) for the module analysis (with THS 9th graders) yields an Average Math Score of 79.0 %. However, the same dataframe (district_summary_df) for the challenge analysis yields an Average Math Score of 78.9%; this is only a 0.1 % difference. Similar small differences are observed for the other overall scores.

## How is the school summary affected?
Similar to the district summary, replacing the ninth graders' reading and math scores had a minimal influence on the overall scores (Average Math Score, Average Reading Scores, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing). For example, the per_school_summary_df in the (file name) for the module analysis (with THS 9th graders) yields an Average Math Score of 83.42 %. However, the same dataframe (district_summary_df) for the challenge analysis yields an Average Math Score of 83.35 %; this is only a 0.07 % difference. Similar small differences are observed for the other overall scores. Remember to put files here

## How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools?
In relation to other schools, replacing the THS 9th graders' reading and math scores puts THS's preformance in the top 5 schools for % Overall Passing. Even with the potential academic misconduct, students from THS preform very well in comparison to other schools.

## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

- Math and reading scores by grade: 
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type
